Let’s take a closer look at the unit. What are the specific things  students need to be able to do at the end of a unit? And what’s your plan for how they should get there? In other words, what are the actions, skills, and knowledge that they need? Wherever possible, focus on the actions that students are taking and not the knowledge itself. Always remember that learning is about doing, and not about content.

For each of your units, list these down in the sequential order in which they should be covered. 

Congratulations again! You now have a rough outline of the lessons that your unit will include. Sometimes, one action or skill can be its own lesson. Other times, it might need to be several lessons. Or in other cases, you can combine multiple actions and skills into a single lesson. Again, you know your topic better than anyone else so use your judgement and shape those expected student actions, skills, and knowledge into lessons.  

Units can also vary in length. We don’t have a standard for how many lessons belong in a unit since we understand that some units take less time to cover while others might be more difficult and need more lessons devoted to them. 

Also remember that when we talk about lessons, we mean both Readmes and Labs. Our typical flow is that every Readme should immediately be followed by a Coding Lab so that a student can immediately apply the skills they’ve just learned. Towards the end of each unit, we also also want to have more difficult labs that encompass multiple concepts (some of which can come from previous units) and require more of students.

Rework your list of lessons from above to include the breakdown of Readmes and Labs in your unit.

And there you go! Now you have a solid high level outline of your course. This will go through several iterations. You might in your process, learn that a unit needs to be broken down even further or that there were missing units and lessons you hadn’t considered. That’s totally fine and expected!
